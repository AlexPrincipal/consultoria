/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CMXS Jurídico.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces an admin-only access model for managing homepage content.
 * Administrative privileges are determined by the existence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/homePageContent/{homePageId}`: Stores the content for the homepage.
 *   There should be a single, well-known ID (e.g., 'main') for the homepage document.
 * - `/roles_admin/{userId}`: Indicates admin status. If a document exists for a user's ID, they are an admin.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Only authenticated admins can create, update, or delete homepage content.
 * - Any user (authenticated or not) can read the homepage content.
 * - The rules explicitly deny write access to the `/roles_admin` collection itself to prevent privilege escalation.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection is used to denormalize admin status. The rules check for the existence of a document in this collection to grant admin privileges, avoiding the need to read data from other documents to determine permissions.
